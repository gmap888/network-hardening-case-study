# Security Risk Assessment - Network Hardening Case Study

This project is part of my cybersecurity learning path. It is a simulated security risk assessment for a social media organization that experienced a data breach due to network vulnerabilities.

## 🔍 Scenario
The organization faced a data breach caused by:
- Password sharing
- Default database admin password
- No firewall rules
- No Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

## 🛠️ Solutions Proposed
- Strong password policy implementation
- Firewall configuration with strict rules
- MFA deployment

## 📄 Report
The detailed risk assessment and hardening recommendations are in this repository.

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated
- Network Hardening
- Risk Assessment
- Incident Analysis
- Security Best Practices Documentation

## 📚 About Me
I'm currently transitioning from QA Engineering to Cybersecurity (Blue Team, SOC, Incident Response). This project is part of my practical portfolio.
